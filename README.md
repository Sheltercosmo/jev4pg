  <strong>A self-developing SQL database with JEV based semantic operators and natural language queries</strong>
</p>

41 JEV based semantic operators and conditional workflows cover classification, extraction, ranking, matching and verification. Parallel evaluation and reusable evidence reduce repeated work. English and Simplified Chinese queries, optional LLM planning, and text-to-table extraction make the database accessible through a web workspace and HTTP API.

The operators combine JEV's native Noul, Choice and Score primitives with database and workflow logic. The default JEV service is provided by TypeSafe. You can also connect a compatible third-party endpoint or a local model adapter. PostgreSQL handles storage, joins and arithmetic.

## Features

* Query data in English or Simplified Chinese. Inspect the SQL, correct its interpretation and rerun it from query history.
* Choose JEV planning or hybrid planning. In hybrid mode, JEV selects relevant context, an LLM proposes SQL, and JEV reviews the proposal.
* Filter and classify text by meaning. Save reviewed definitions as reusable features, such as whether a message requests action.
* Extract database entries from documents. Describe the rows and columns, then review typed values alongside their source text before importing.
* Preview inserts, updates and deletes before committing them.
* Call semantic operators for extraction, ranking, matching, verification and conditional workflows.
* Use TypeSafe, a compatible hosted endpoint or a local Python model adapter without changing operator calls.

The self-developing part is the semantic layer: definitions, evidence and corrections can be saved, reviewed, reused and refreshed as data changes. New concepts require approval before promotion.

## Getting started

You need Python 3.11 or newer, PostgreSQL and a configured JEV provider. TypeSafe requires an API key; a local provider can run without one. Python 3.13 and PostgreSQL 17 are the verified configuration. Hybrid mode also requires a configured LLM provider.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sheltercosmo/jevsd-pg.git
cd jevsd-pg
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in PowerShell or `source .venv/bin/activate` in Bash, then install:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.lock.txt
python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and follow the [database setup](docs/INSTALLATION.md#postgresql) to create the application role and configure credentials. Then run:

```bash
python -m scripts.migrate_generic
python -m sdd.cli serve
```

Open the [English workspace](http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask/en) or [Simplified Chinese workspace](http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask/zh). Connect with your database access token and import data through Manage data.

## Query your data

Select a dataset and enter a question such as:

> For each supplier, show the total quantity delivered, largest total first.

Choose Preview plan to inspect the SQL. You can edit a planning decision, select an alternative interpretation or edit the SQL directly. Run the query when the proposal matches your intent. Data changes require a separate commit.

The same workflow is available through `POST /ask`:

```json
{
  "question": "For each supplier, show the total quantity delivered, largest total first.",
  "dataset_ids": ["deliveries"],
  "planner_mode": "hybrid",
  "execute": false
}
```

Use an ID or name from your catalog in `dataset_ids`. Set `planner_mode` to `jev` to plan without LLM generation. See the [query API guide](docs/NATURAL_LANGUAGE.md) and the local [API reference](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) for authentication and complete requests.

## Semantic operators

The API provides 41 operators and `WORKFLOW`. For example, send this request to `POST /jev/call` to test a proposition:

```json
{
  "operator": "JEV.NOUL",
  "arguments": {
    "state": "The shipment arrived on Tuesday.",
    "proposition": "The shipment has arrived."
  },
  "limits": {"max_judgments": 1, "max_requests": 1}
}
```

Results distinguish a known value, an unknown answer and work that was not evaluated. Independent judgments can run in parallel; compatible evidence can be reused.

Use the [operator guide](docs/JEV_OPERATORS.md) to select an operator and set budgets. The [function reference](docs/JEV_FUNCTION_REFERENCE.md) includes arguments, examples and result contracts for every operator.

## Performance and limitations

Independent semantic decisions run in parallel and compatible questions share a request. Cached evidence is scoped to the provider, model revision, source and question. Changing providers does not reuse their model judgments.

This release adds provider compatibility; it does not establish equal accuracy or speed across models. JEV planning supports a bounded set of query structures. All modes can produce incorrect interpretations, so inspect proposals and result completeness before relying on them. Model weights are not included.

See [provider setup](docs/PROVIDERS.md) for local and hosted configuration and [performance and cost](docs/PERFORMANCE_AND_COST.md) for usage controls and validation scope.
