# JEV function reference

The JEV.* sections give the `arguments` object for `POST /jev/call`. Set `operator` to the section name:

```json
{
  "operator": "JEV.NOUL",
  "arguments": {
    "state": "The work is complete.",
    "proposition": "The source reports completed work."
  }
}
```

Use your database bearer token. Most examples run on supplied text; examples with `<placeholders>` require IDs from earlier operations. All calls retain a run/evidence record. REVIEW, PROMOTE, MATERIALIZE and REFRESH require a reviewer token; DISCOVER saves provisional definitions.

Inspect `output_state` before reading `value`. Incomplete results use `partial_value`; observations keep their individual output and operation states. Model-dependent examples illustrate inputs and result shapes, not guaranteed labels. Shared budgets, authorization and state rules are in the [operator guide](JEV_OPERATORS.md).

Optional execution controls belong beside `operator` and `arguments`, for example `"limits": {"max_judgments": 100, "concurrency": 4}`. Do not pass the outer budget as an operator argument. Most population parameters also accept `{"dataset_id":"...","where":{"team":"North"}}`; registered datasets require a primary key. Direct states for NOUL, CHOICE, SCORE and COMPARE are literal input values.

The same complete request examples are available from `GET /jev/operators/examples` and each catalog entry's `usage` field. The source is [examples.json](../sdd/operators/examples.json); rebuild this reference with `python -m scripts.build_operator_docs`.

## Native PostgreSQL embedding functions

These development functions run in the Rust extension through SQL. See [native embeddings](NATIVE_EMBEDDINGS.md) for setup, basis definitions and a runnable example.

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `jev_native.embed(source_sql, basis, options)` | Evaluate a shared question basis and return a probability matrix and vector for each source row. |
| `jev_native.answer_matrix(basis, decisions, evaluator)` | Project existing typed decisions into the same representation without model calls. |
| `jev_native.embedding_distance(left, right)` | Compare complete matrices with matching basis and evaluator identities locally. |

}
```

Returns: Subject IDs map to concept-indexed decisions; compatible questions share a context.

## JEV.FILTER

Separate matching, rejected and unresolved subjects.

`filter(relation, concept_rev, mode='exhaustive')`

Returns: Blocks with line offsets and type decisions; original source text round-trips exactly.

## JEV.ROUTE

Choose a handler and arguments from explicit allowlists.

`route(request, allowed_handlers, candidate_args=None)`

Choose an allowed handler for an input; dispatch remains the caller's responsibility.

```json

Returns: Concept decisions per subject. Optional evaluator_revs must match the configured pinned model.

## JEV.MATERIALIZE

Publish a generation for an approved concept and registered population.

`materialize(concept_rev, target_scope, refresh_policy, budget=None)`

Publish resolved values for an approved definition and registered source.

Requires: Reviewer token; use PROMOTE.value.approved_revision.id and an existing primary-key dataset ID.

```json
{
  "concept_rev": "<approved_revision>",
  "target_scope": {
    "dataset_id": "<dataset_id>"
  },
  "refresh_policy": {
    "mode": "explicit"
  }
}
```

Returns: A generation, published flag and observations. on_change requires max_refreshes (1–100) and interval_seconds (at least 30).

## JEV.REFRESH

Invalidate specified source dependencies and rebuild selected generations.

`refresh(change_set, policies=None, budget=None)`

Rebuild a materialized generation after its source dependencies change.

Requires: Reviewer token; use MATERIALIZE.value.generation.id. Dataset invalidation affects that whole dataset; use row revision hashes for narrower invalidation.

```json
{
  "change_set": {
    "source_revisions": [
      "<dataset_id>"
    ],
    "reason": "Source records changed."
  },
  "policies": [
    "<generation_id>"
  ]
}
```

Returns: Invalidated observation IDs and replacement generations, using the outer execution budget.

## JEV.REVIEW

Save a human assertion without overwriting the model evidence.

`review(observations, sampling_policy=None, reviewer_role=None)`

Record a human correction without replacing the original model observation.

Requires: Reviewer token; take observation_id from an evaluated run’s observations.

```json
{
  "observations": [
    {
      "observation_id": "<observation_id>",
      "value": false,
      "reason": "The source promises future work; it does not report completion."
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns: Saved assertions and confirmation that raw evidence is unchanged.

## JEV.PROMOTE

Approve a provisional concept using independently reviewed evidence.

`promote(candidate_rev, owner, validation_report, retention_policy)`

Approve a provisional definition after reviewing independent examples.

Requires: Reviewer token; use DISCOVER.value.candidates[0].candidate_revision and replace the sample validation report with your actual review.

```json
{
  "candidate_rev": "<candidate_revision>",
  "owner": "reviewer-name",
  "validation_report": {
    "independent_holdout": [
      "<reviewed_holdout_id>"
    ],
    "reviewed_examples": [
      {
        "text": "The work remains pending.",
        "expected": false
      }
    ]
  },
  "retention_policy": "Retain this approved definition for 30 days."
}
```

Returns: An approved revision ID; no backfill starts until MATERIALIZE.

## JEV.SELECT_SCHEMA

Select relevant authorized tables and fields.

`select_schema(request, authorized_catalog=None, candidate_policy=None)`

Select relevant catalog elements for a natural-language objective.

Requires: Existing dataset ID. Omit authorized_catalog to use the visible catalog within pilot limits.

```json
{
  "request": "Count completed records by team.",
  "authorized_catalog": [
    "<dataset_id>"
  ]
}
```

Returns: Selected tables/columns, catalog alternatives and approved relationship metadata.

## JEV.PLAN_SQL

Construct a staged SQL proposal for a natural-language request.

`plan_sql(request, catalog_rev=None, grammar_rev='staged-v1', mode='proposal')`

Obtain a SQL proposal for inspection without executing it.

Requires: Existing dataset ID. catalog_rev currently accepts the dataset-ID list used by the planner.

```json
{
  "request": "Count records by team.",
  "catalog_rev": [
    "<dataset_id>"
  ]
}
```

Returns: A reviewable plan and executed=false. A held proposal remains available; this function does not execute SQL.

## JEV.EXPLAIN_PLAN

Estimate missing semantic work before inference.

`explain_plan(typed_plan, source_stats=None, limits=None, cache_stats=None)`

Estimate required semantic work before dispatching provider calls.

```json
{
  "typed_plan": {
    "operator": "TAG",
    "stages": 1
  },
  "source_stats": {
    "subjects": 100,
    "questions": 2,
    "tokens_per_judgment": 300
  },
  "cache_stats": {
    "compatible_judgments": 20
  }
}
```

Returns: Judgments, conservative requests/cost bounds and policy warnings; this is an estimate, not an approval or guaranteed duration.

## JEV.CLASSIFY_HIERARCHY

Classify along bounded parallel taxonomy frontiers.

`classify_hierarchy(subjects, taxonomy_rev, beam_width=2, depth_cap=6)`

Select a category through a supplied hierarchy when one flat choice is unsuitable.

```json
{
  "subjects": [
    {
      "id": "a",
      "text": "The requested work was completed yesterday."
    },
    {
      "id": "b",
      "text": "Please finish the work tomorrow."
    }
  ],
  "taxonomy_rev": {
    "root": "message",
    "nodes": {
      "message": {
        "children": [
          "request",
          "update"
        ]
      },
      "request": {
        "description": "Requests future action"
      },
      "update": {
        "description": "Reports a status"
      }
    }
  },
  "beam_width": 2,
  "depth_cap": 3
}
```

Returns: Candidate paths, heuristic weights, dropped branches and unfinished paths.

## JEV.WORKFLOW

Run independent stages together and respect typed branch conditions.

`workflow(stages)`

Compose typed stages with explicit dependencies and conditional branches.

```json
{
  "stages": [
    {
      "id": "gate",
      "literal": false
    },
    {
      "id": "stage2",
      "when": {
        "stage": "gate",
        "equals": true
      },
      "state": "The requested work was completed yesterday.",
      "question": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "The source reports completed work, rather than a promise or request."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns: Stage decisions and execution layers. In this example stage2 is NOT_EVALUATED / SKIPPED and no provider call is needed.

## JEV.EXTRACT_TABLE

Create typed, source-backed rows using descriptions of records and columns.

`extract_table(text, columns, row_description, record_mode='auto', max_rows=200)`

Turn a document into typed rows using descriptions of records and columns.

```json
{
  "text": "Supplier Northwind supplied 12 valves for $1,250.50.\nSupplier Eastbank supplied 8 valves for $840.00.",
  "row_description": "One row for each supplier delivery.",
  "record_mode": "line",
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "supplier",
      "type": "text",
      "description": "The supplier name, without the word Supplier."
    },
    {
      "name": "quantity",
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "The number of valves delivered."
    },
    {
      "name": "amount",
      "type": "number",
      "description": "The total amount charged for the delivery."
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns: Rows with exact source offsets, typed values and per-cell states. Missing or uncertain values remain unresolved. Four stages run by default. See TEXT_IMPORT.md for automatic insertion.
